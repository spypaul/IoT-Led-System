# IoT-Led-System
## Description
This is a project built on Arduino Mega 2560, ESP 32 dev board, Nexys A7 FPGA, and the HC-05 Bluetooth Module. There are three main parts of the system: the communication between Arduino and FPGA, LED control, and wifi webserver. First, I created a UART interface in Verilog on the Nexys A7 to drive the Bluetooth modules. The FPGA will send the temperature data(switches data in the project) and the calculated PWM data(calculated on the FPGA according to the temperature data) to the Arduino Mega through Bluetooth. Secondly, ESP 32 will be the web server for a website that would show the temperature data and button to control LED states(on/off). Finally, the Mega board will communicate with ESP 32 to get LED state, and the brightness will be determined by the temperature data.
